<l>


IT's all I have to bring to-day,


</l>
<l>


This, and my heart beside,


</l>
<l>


This, and my heart, and all the fields,


</l>
<l>


And all the meadows wide.


</l>
<l>


Be sure you count, should I forget,—


</l>
<l>


Some one the sum could tell,—


</l>
<l>


This, and my heart, and all the bees


</l>
<l>


Which in the clover dwell.

<l>
I HAD a guinea golden;
</l>
<l>
I lost it in the sand,
</l>
<l>
And though the sum was simple,
</l>
<l>
And pounds were in the land,
</l>
<l>
Still had it such a value
</l>
<l>
Unto my frugal eye,
</l>
<l>
That when I could not find it
</l>
<l>
I sat me down to sigh. 
</l>
<l>
I had a crimson robin
</l>
<l>
Who sang full many a day,
</l>
<l>
But when the woods were painted
</l>
<l>
He, too, did fly away.
</l>
<l>
Time brought me other robins, —
</l>
<l>
Their ballads were the same, —
</l>
<l>
Still for my missing troubadour
</l>
<l>
I kept the 'house at hame.' 
</l>
<l>
I had a star in heaven;
</l>
<l>
One Pleiad was its name,
</l>
<l>
And when I was not heeding
</l>
<l>
It wandered from the same.
</l>
<l>
And though the skies are crowded,
</l>
<l>
And all the night ashine,
</l>
<l>
I do not care about it,
</l>
<l>
Since none of them are mine.
</l>
<l>
My story has a moral:
</l>
<l>
I have a missing friend, —
</l>
<l>
Pleiad its name, and robin,
</l>
<l>
And guinea in the sand, —
</l>
<l>
And when this mournful ditty,
</l>
<l>
Accompanied with tear,
</l>
<l>
Shall meet the eye of traitor
</l>
<l>
In country far from here,
</l>
<l>
Grant that repentance solemn
</l>
<l>
May seize upon his mind,
</l>
<l>
And he no consolation
</l>
<l>
Beneath the sun may find.

<l>
I MEASURE every grief I meet
</l>
<l>
With analytic eyes;
</l>
<l>
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
</l>
<l>
Or has an easier size.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if they bore it long,
</l>
<l>
Or did it just begin?
</l>
<l>
I could not tell the date of mine,
</l>
<l>
It feels so old a pain.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if it hurts to live,
</l>
<l>
And if they have to try,
</l>
<l>
And whether, could they choose between,
</l>
<l>
They would not rather die.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if when years have piled —
</l>
<l>
Some thousands — on the cause
</l>
<l>
Of early  hurt, if such a lapse 
</l>
<l>
Could give them any pause;
</l>
<l>
Or would they go on aching still
</l>
<l>
Through centuries above,
</l>
<l>
Enlightened to a larger pain
</l>
<l>
By contrast with the love.
</l>
<l>
The grieved are many, I am told;
</l>
<l>
The reason deeper lies, —
</l>
<l>
Death is but one and comes but once,
</l>
<l>
And only nails the eyes.
</l>
<l>
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, —
</l>
<l>
A sort they call 'despair;'
</l>
<l>
There's banishment from native eyes,
</l>
<l>
In sight of native air.
</l>
<l>
And though I may not guess the kind
</l>
<l>
Correctly, yet to me

<l>
I HAVE a king who does not speak;
</l>
<l>
So, wondering, thro' the hours meek
</l>
<l>
I trudge the day away,—
</l>
<l>
Half glad when it is night and sleep,
</l>
<l>
If, haply, thro' a dream to peep
</l>
<l>
In parlors shut by day.
</l>
<l>
And if I do, when morning comes,
</l>
<l>
It is as if a hundred drums
</l>
<l>
Did round my pillow roll.
</l>
<l>
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
</l>
<l>
And bells keep saying 'victory'
</l>
<l>
From steeples in my soul!
</l>
<l>
And if I don't, the little Bird
</l>
<l>
Within the Orchard is not heard,
</l>
<l>
And I omit to pray,
</l>
<l>
'Father, thy will be done'  to-day,
</l>
<l>
For my will goes the other way,
</l>
<l>
And it were perjury!

Lock the door!

When I am occupied.

And praise as mere as blame.

<l>
THE moon was but a chin of gold
</l>
<l>
A night or two ago,
</l>
<l>
And now she turns her perfect face
</l>
<l>
Upon the world below.
</l>
<l>
Her forehead is of amplest blond;
</l>
<l>
Her cheek like beryl stone;
</l>
<l>
Her eye unto the sumtner dew
</l>
<l>
The likest I have known.
</l>
<l>
Her lips of amber never part;
</l>
<l>
But what must be the smile
</l>
<l>
Upon her friend she could bestow
</l>
<l>
Were such her silver will!
</l>
<l>
And what a privilege to be
</l>
<l>
But the remotest star!
</l>
<l>
For certainly her way might pass
</l>
<l>
Beside your twinkling door.
</l>
<l>
Her bonnet is the firmament,
</l>
<l>
The universe her shoe,
</l>
<l>
The stars the trinkets at her belt,
</l>
<l>
Her dimities of blue.

<poem id="CX0" publisher="Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, and Co." year="1914" editor="Todd, Mabel Loomis, 1856-1932" title="XXII. THE BAT.">
<l>
THE bat is dun with wrinkled wings
</l>
<l>
Like fallow article,
</l>
<l>
And not a song pervades his lips,
</l>
<l>
Or none perceptible.
</l>
<l>
His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
</l>
<l>
Describing in the air
</l>
<l>
An arc alike inscrutable, —
</l>
<l>
Elate philosopher! 
</l>
<l>
Deputed from what firmament
</l>
<l>
Of what astute abode,
</l>
<l>
Empowered with what malevolence
</l>
<l>
Auspiciously withheld.
</l>
<l>
To his adroit Creator 
</l>
<l>
Ascribe no less the praise;
</l>
<l>
Beneficent, believe me,
</l>
<l>
His eccentricities.

<l>
YOU've seen balloons set, haven't you?
</l>
<l>
So stately they ascend
</l>
<l>
It is as swans discarded you
</l>
<l>
For duties diamond.
</l>
<l>
Their liquid feet go softly out
</l>
<l>
Upon a sea of blond;
</l>
<l>
They spurn the air as 't were too mean
</l>
<l>
For creatures so renowned.
</l>
<l>
Their ribbons just beyond the eye,
</l>
<l>
They struggle some for breath,
</l>
<l>
And yet the crowd applauds below;
</l>
<l>
They would not encore death.
</l>
<l>
The gilded creature strains and spins,
</l>
<l>
Trips frantic in a tree,
</l>
<l>
Tears open her imperial veins
</l>
<l>
And tumbles in the sea.
</l>
<l>
The crowd retire with an oath
</l>
<l>
The dust in streets goes down,
</l>
<l>
And clerks in counting-rooms observe,
</l>
<l>
''T was only a balloon.'

<l>
THE cricket sang,
</l>
<l>
And set the sun,
</l>
<l>
And workmen finished, one by one,
</l>
<l>
Their seam the day upon.
</l>
<l>
The low grass loaded with the dew,
</l>
<l>
The twilight stood as strangers do
</l>
<l>
With hat in hand, polite and new,
</l>
<l>
To stay as if, or go. 
</l>
<l>
A vastness, as a neighbor, came, —
</l>
<l>
A wisdom without face or name,
</l>
<l>
A peace, as hemispheres at home, —
</l>
<l>
And so the night became.

The north, to-night!

So adequate its forms,

So preconcerted with itself,

<l>
So distant to alarms, —
</l>
<l>
An unconcern so sovereign
</l>
<l>
To universe, or me,
</l>
<l>
It paints my simple spirit
</l>
<l>
With tints of majesty,
</l>
<l>
Till I take vaster attitudes,
</l>
<l>
And strut upon my stem,
</l>
<l>
Disdaining men and oxygen,
</l>
<l>
For arrogance of them.
</l>
<l>
My splendors are menagerie;
</l>
<l>
But their competeless show
</l>
<l>
Will entertain the centuries

An island in dishonored grass,

<l>
HOW the old mountains drip with sunset,
</l>
<l>
And the brake of dun! 
</l>
<l>
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
</l>
<l>
By the wizard sun!
</l>
<l>
How the old steeples hand the scarlet,
</l>
<l>
Till the ball is full, —
</l>
<l>
Have I the lip of the flamingo 
</l>
<l>
That I dare to tell?
</l>
<l>
Then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
</l>
<l>
Touching all the grass
</l>
<l>
With a departing, sapphire feature,
</l>
<l>
As if a duchess pass! 
</l>
<l>
How a small dusk crawls on the village
</l>
<l>
Till the houses blot;
</l>
<l>
And the odd flambeaux no men carry
</l>
<l>
Glimmer on the spot! 
</l>
<l>
Now it is night in nest and kennel,
</l>
<l>
And where was the wood,
</l>
<l>
Just a dome of abyss is nodding
</l>
<l>
Into solitude! —
</l>
<l>
These are the visions baffled Guido;
</l>
<l>
Titian never told;
</l>
<l>
Domenichino dropped the pencil,
</l>
<l>
Powerless to unfold.

It beckons and it baffles;

Philosophies don't know,

Sagacity must go.

Kept treading, treading, till it seemed

A service like a drum

Kept beating, beating, till I thought

Of earl and midge
</l>
<l>
The privilege.
</l>
<l>
Why swagger then?
</l>
<l>
The gnat's supremacy
</l>
<l>
Is large as thine.

<l>
FAR from love the Heavenly Father
</l>
<l>
Leads the chosen child;
</l>
<l>
Oftener through realm of briar
</l>
<l>
Than the meadow mild,
</l>
<l>
Oftener by the claw of dragon
</l>
<l>
Than the hand of friend,
</l>
<l>
Guides the little one predestined
</l>
<l>
To the native land.

<poem id="DD4" publisher="Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, and Co." year="1914" editor="Todd, Mabel Loomis, 1856-1932" title="LVII. SLEEPING.">
<l>
A LONG, long sleep, a famous sleep
</l>
<l>
That makes no show for dawn
</l>
<l>
By stretch of limb or stir of lid, —
</l>
<l>
An independent one.
</l>
<l>
Was ever idleness like this?
</l>
<l>
Within a hut of stone
</l>
<l>
To bask the centuries away
</l>
<l>
Nor once look up for noon?
</l>

<poem id="DD5" publisher="Boston, Mass.: Little, Brown, and Co." year="1914" editor="Todd, Mabel Loomis, 1856-1932" title=" LVIII. RETROSPECT.">
<l>
'T WAS just this time last year I died.
</l>
<l>
I know I heard the corn,
</l>
<l>
When I was carried by the farms, —
</l>
<l>
 It had the tassels on.
</l>
<l>
I thought how yellow it would look
</l>
<l>
When Richard went to mill;
</l>
<l>
And then I wanted to get out,
</l>
<l>
But something held my will.
</l>
<l>
I thought just how red apples wedged
</l>
<l>
The stubble's joints between;
</l>
<l>
And carts went stooping round the fields
</l>
<l>
To take the pumpkins in.
</l>
<l>
I wondered which would miss me least,
</l>
<l>
And when Thanksgiving came,
</l>
<l>
If father 'd multiply the plates
</l>
<l>
To make an even sum.
</l>
<l>
And if my stocking hung too high,
</l>
<l>
Would it blur the Christmas glee,
</l>
<l>
That not a Santa Claus could reach
</l>
<l>
The altitude of me? 
</l>
<l>
But this sort grieved myself, and so
</l>
<l>
I thought how it would be
</l>
<l>
When just this time, some perfect year,
</l>
<l>
Themselves should come to me.

<l>
ON this wondrous sea,
</l>
<l>
Sailing silently,
</l>
<l>
Ho! pilot, ho!
</l>
<l>
Knowest thou the shore
</l>
<l>
Where no breakers roar,
</l>
<l>
Where the storm is o'er?
</l>
<l>
In the silent west
</l>
<l>
Many sails at rest,
</l>
<l>
Their anchors fast;
</l>
<l>
Thither I pilot thee, —
</l>
<l>
Land, ho! Eternity!
</l>
<l>
Ashore at last!
