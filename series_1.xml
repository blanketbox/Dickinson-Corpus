<l>
THIS is my letter to the world,
</l>
<l>
 That never wrote to me,— 
</l>
<l>
 The simple news that nature told, 
</l>
<l>
 With tender magesty. 
</l>
<l>
Her message is committed
</l>
<l>
To hands I cannot see;
</l>
<l>
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
</l>
<l>
Judge tenderly of me!

<l>
SUCCESS is counted sweetest
</l>
<l>
By those who ne'er succeed.
</l>
<l>
To comprehend a nectar
</l>
<l>
Requires sorest need.
</l>
<l>
Not one of all the purple host
</l>
<l>
Who took the flag to-day
</l>
<l>
Can tell the definition,
</l>
<l>
So clear, of victory,
</l>
<l>
As he, defeated, dying,
</l>
<l>
On whose forbidden ear
</l>
<l>
The distant strains of triumph
</l>
<l>
Break, agonized and clear.

<l>
OUR share of night to bear,
</l>
<l>
Our share of morning,
</l>
<l>
Our blank in bliss to fill,
</l>
<l>
Our blank in scorning.
</l>
<l>
Here a star, and there a star,
</l>
<l>
Some lose their way.
</l>
<l>
Here a mist, and there a mist,

<l>
Afterwards — day!

<l>
SOUL, wilt thou toss again?
</l>
<l>
By just such a hazard
</l>
<l>
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
</l>
<l>
But tens have won an all.
</l>
<l>
Angels' breathless ballot

'T IS so much joy! 'T is so much joy!

And yet, as poor as I

<l>
Have ventured all upon a throw;
</l>
<l>
Have gained! Yes!            Hesitated so

<l>
This side the victory!

Life is but life, and death but death!

<l>
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!

And if. indeed, I fail,

<l>
At least to know the worst is sweet.

Defeat means nothing but defeat,

GLEE! the great storm is over!

Four have recovered the land;

<l>
Forty gone down together

Into the boiling sand.
</l>
<l>
Ring, for the scant salvation!
</l>
<l>
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
</l>
<l>
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
</l>
<l>
Spinning upon the shoals!
</l>
<l>
How they will tell the shipwreck
</l>
<l>
When winter shakes the door,
</l>
<l>
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
</l>
<l>
Did they come back no more?"
</l>
<l>
Then a silence suffuses the story,
</l>
<l>
And a softness the teller's eye;
</l>
<l>
And the children no further question.
</l>
<l>
And only the waves reply.

Soft sauntered through the village,

Sauntered as soft away!
</l>

So unsuspected violets

Within the fields lie low,

Too late for striving fingers

That passed, an hour ago.

'T is but the ecstasy of death,

And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,

A cheek is always redder

<l>
A PRECIOUS, mouldering pleasure 't is
</l>
<l>
To meet an antique book,
</l>
<l>
In just the dress his century wore;
</l>
<l>
A privilege, I think,
</l>
<l>
His venerable hand to take,
</l>
<l>
And warming in our own,
</l>
<l>
A passage back, or two, to make
</l>
<l>
To times when he was young.
</l>
<l>
His quaint opinions to inspect,
</l>
<l>
His knowledge to unfold
</l>
<l>
On what concerns our mutual mind,
</l>
<l>
The literature of old;
</l>
<l>
What interested scholars most,
</l>
<l>
What competitions ran
</l>
<l>
When Plato was a certainty,
</l>
<l>
And Sophocles a man;
</l>
<l>
When Sappho was a living girl,
</l>
<l>
And Beatrice wore
</l>
<l>
The gown that Dante deified.
</l>
<l>
Facts, centuries before,
</l>
<l>
He traverses familiar,
</l>
<l>
As one should come to town
</l>
<l>
And tell you all your dreams were true:
</l>
<l>
He lived where dreams were sown.
</l>
<l>
His presence is enchantment,
</l>
<l>
You beg him not to go;
</l>
<l>
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
</l>
<l>
And tantalize, just so.

THE soul selects her own society,

On her divine majority

Obtrude no more.
</l>
<l>
Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
</l>
<l>
At her low gate;
</l>
<l>
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
</l>
<l>
Upon her mat.
</l>
<l>
I've known her from an ample nation
</l>
<l>
Choose one;
</l>
<l>
Then close the valves of her attention

Like stone.

Some things that stay there be, —

Grief, hills, eternity:

<poem id="AB8" publisher="Boston: Roberts Brothers" year="1891" title="XV. THE LONELY HOUSE.">
<l>
I KNOW some lonely houses off the road
</l>
<l>
A robber 'd like the look of,—
</l>
<l>
Wooden barred,
</l>
<l>
And windows hanging low,
</l>
<l>
Inviting to
</l>
<l>
A portico,
</l>
<l>
Where two could creep:
</l>
<l>
One hand the tools,
</l>
<l>
The other peep
</l>
<l>
To make sure all's asleep.
</l>
<l>
Old-fashioned eyes,
</l>
<l>
Not easy to surprise!
</l>
<l>
How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
</l>
<l>
With just a clock,—
</l>
<l>
But they could gag the tick,
</l>
<l>
And mice won't bark;
</l>
<l>
And so the walls don't tell,
</l>
<l>
None will.
</l>
<l>
A pair of spectacles afar just stir —
</l>
<l>
An almanac's aware.
</l>
<l>
Was it the mat winked,
</l>
<l>
Or a nervous star?
</l>
<l>
The moon slides down the stair
</l>
<l>
To see who's there.
</l>
<l>
There's plunder, — where?
</l>
<l>
Tankard, or spoon,
</l>
<l>
Earring, or stone,
</l>
<l>
A watch, some ancient brooch
</l>
<l>
To match the grandmamma,
</l>
<l>
Staid sleeping there.
</l>
<l>
Day rattles, too,
</l>
<l>
Stealth's slow;
</l>
<l>
The sun has got as far
</l>
<l>
As the third sycamore.
</l>
<l>
Screams chanticleer,
</l>
<l>
"Who's there?"
</l>
<l>
And echoes, trains away,
</l>
<l>
Sneer— " Where?"
</l>
<l>
While the old couple, just astir,
</l>
<l>
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!

<l>
TO fight aloud is very brave,
</l>
<l>
But gallanter, I know,

<l>
Who charge within the bosom,
</l>

The cavalry of woe.
</l>
<l>
Who win, and nations do not see,
</l>
<l>
Who fall, and none observe,
</l>
<l>
Whose dying eyes no country

<l>
Regards with patriot love.
</l>
<l>
We trust, in plumed procession,

Rank after rank, with even feet

The faithful witness,

<l>
Till we are helped,

As if a kingdom cared!

<l>
Read then of faith

<l>
That shone above the fagot;

<l>
Clear strains of hymn

The river could not drown;

Brave names of men

And celestial women,

<l>
Passed out of record

Into renown!

<l>
PAIN has an element of blank;
</l>
<l>
It cannot recollect

<l>
When it began, or if there were
</l>
<l>
A day when it was not.
</l>

It has no future but itself,

Its infinite realms contain

Its past, enlightened to perceive

New periods of pain.

HAVE you got a brook in your little heart,

Where bashful flowers blow,

<l>
And blushing birds go down to drink,
</l>
<l>
And shadows tremble so?
</l>
<l>
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
</l>
<l>
That any brook is there;
</l>
<l>
And yet your little draught of life
</l>
<l>
Is daily drunken there.
</l>

Then look out for the little brook in March,
</l>
<l>
When the rivers overflow,
</l>

And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
</l>
<l>
And the bridges often go.
</l>
<l>
And later, in August it may be,
</l>

When the meadows parching lie,

Beware, lest this little brook of life

Some burning noon go dry!

Entirely for me;

I thought that such were for the saints,
</l>
<l>
Where revelations be.
</l>
<l>
The sun, as common, went abroad,
</l>
<l>
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
</l>
<l>
As if no soul the solstice passed
</l>
<l>
That maketh all things new.
</l>
<l>
The time was scarce profaned by speech;
</l>
<l>
The symbol of a word
</l>
<l>
Was needless, as at sacrament
</l>
<l>
The wardrobe of our Lord.
</l>
<l>
Each was to each the sealed church,
</l>
<l>
Permitted to commune this time,
</l>
<l>
Lest we too awkward show
</l>
<l>
At supper of the Lamb.
</l>
<l>
The hours slid fast, as hours will,
</l>
<l>
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
</l>
<l>
So faces on two decks look back,
</l>
<l>
Bound to opposing lands.
</l>
<l>
And so, when all the time had failed,
</l>
<l>
Without external sound,
</l>
<l>
Each bound the other's crucifix,
</l>
<l>
We gave no other bond.
</l>
<l>
Sufficient troth that we shall rise—
</l>
<l>
Deposed, at length, the grave—
</l>
<l>
To that new marriage, justified
</l>
<l>
Through Calvaries of Love!

My second rank, too small the first,

Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,

In sovereign, swerveless tune.

Surrendering the last,

When cancelled by the frost.

His breast, a single onyx

To know if any human eyes were near

To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,

Until it settled firm on Paradise.

Was dying as he thought, or different;

Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?

THE last night that she lived,

It was a common night,

Except the dying; this to us

Made nature different.
</l>

Italicized, as 't were.

A jealousy for her arose

We waited while she passed;

<l>
It was a narrow time,

<l>
Too jostled were our souls to speak,
</l>
<l>
At length the notice came.
</l>
<l>
She mentioned, and forgot;
</l>
<l>
Then lightly as a reed
</l>
<l>
Bent to the water, shivered scarce,
</l>
<l>
Consented, and was dead.
</l>
<l>
And we, we placed the hair,

And drew the head erect;

And then an awful leisure was,

Our faith to regulate.
