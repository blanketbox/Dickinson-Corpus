<l>


MY nosegays are for captives;


</l>
<l>


Dim, long-expectant eyes, 


</l>
<l>


Fingers denied the plucking, 


</l>
<l>


Patient till paradise.


</l>
<l>
To such, if they should whisper
</l>
<l>
Of morning and the moor,
</l>
<l>
They bear no other errand, 
</l>
<l>
And I, no other prayer.

I 'M nobody!  Who are you?

Are you nobody, too?

Then there 's a pair of us — don't tell!

<l>
They 'd banish us, you know.

<l>
How dreary to be somebody!

<l>
How public, like a frog

To tell your name the livelong day
</l>
<l>
To an admiring bog!

<l>
I BRING an unaccustomed wine
</l>
<l>
To lips long parching, next to mine,
</l>
<l>
And summon them to drink.
</l>
<l>
Crackling with fever, they essay;
</l>
<l>
I turn my brimming eyes away,
</l>
<l>
And come next hour to look.
</l>
<l>
The hands still hug the tardy glass;
</l>
<l>
The lips I would have cooled, alas!
</l>
<l>
Are so superfluous cold,
</l>
<l>
I would as soon attempt to warm
</l>
<l>
The bosoms where the frost has lain
</l>
<l>
Ages beneath the mould.
</l>
<l>
Some other thirsty there may be
</l>
<l>
To whom this would have pointed me
</l>
<l>
Had it remained to speak.
</l>
<l>
And so I always bear the cup
</l>
<l>
If, haply, mine may be the drop
</l>
<l>
Some pilgrim thirst to slake, —
</l>
<l>
If, haply, any say to me,
</l>
<l>
"Unto the little, unto me,"
</l>
<l>
When I at last awake.

<l>
THE nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
</l>
<l>
The heaven we chase

Like the June bee

Before the school-boy
</l>
<l>
Invites the race;
</l>
<l>
Stoops to an easy clover —
</l>
<l>
Dips — evades — teases — deploys;
</l>
<l>
Then to the royal clouds
</l>
<l>
Lifts his light pinnace
</l>
<l>
Heedless of the boy
</l>
<l>
Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.
</l>
<l>
Homesick for steadfast honey,
</l>
<l>
Ah! the bee flies not

That brews that rare variety;

HOPE is the thing with feathers

And sweetest in the gale is heard;

<l>
And sore must be the storm

<l>
That could abash the little bird
</l>
<l>
That kept so many warm.
</l>
<l>
I 've heard it in the chillest land,
</l>
<l>
And on the strangest sea;
</l>
<l>
Yet, never, in extremity,
</l>
<l>
It asked a crumb of me.

<l>
DARE you see a soul at the white heat?
</l>
<l>
Then crouch within the door.

<l>
Red is the fire's common tint;

<l>
But when the vivid ore
</l>
<l>
Has sated flame's conditions,
</l>
<l>
Its quivering substance plays
</l>
<l>
Without a color but the light
</l>
<l>
Of unanointed blaze.
</l>
<l>
Least village boasts its blacksmith,
</l>
<l>
Whose anvil's even din
</l>
<l>
Stands symbol for the finer forge
</l>
<l>
That soundless tugs within,
</l>
<l>
Refining these impatient ores
</l>
<l>
With hammer and with blaze,
</l>
<l>
Until the designated light
</l>
<l>
Repudiate the forge.

</l>
<l>
Who never climbed the weary league —
</l>
<l>
Can such a foot explore
</l>
<l>
The purple territories

<l>
On Pizarro's shore?

How many legions overcome?

How many colors taken

<l>
I CAN wade grief,
</l>
<l>
Whole pools of it, —
</l>
<l>
I 'm used to that.
</l>
<l>
But the least push of joy
</l>
<l>
Breaks up my feet,
</l>
<l>
And I tip — drunken.
</l>
<l>
Let no pebble smile,
</l>
<l>
'T was the new liquor, —
</l>
<l>
That was all!
</l>
<l>
Power is only pain,
</l>
<l>
Stranded, through discipline,
</l>
<l>
Till weights will hang.
</l>
<l>
Give balm to giants,
</l>
<l>
And they 'll wilt, like men.
</l>
<l>
Give Himmaleh, —
</l>
<l>
They 'll carry him!

<l>
I NEVER hear the word "escape"
</l>
<l>
Without a quicker blood,
</l>
<l>
A sudden expectation,
</l>
<l>
A flying attitude.
</l>
<l>
I never hear of prisons broad
</l>
<l>
By soldiers battered down,
</l>
<l>
But I tug childish at my bars, —
</l>
<l>
Only to fail again!

<l>
FOR each ecstatic instant
</l>
<l>
We must an anguish pay
</l>
<l>
In keen and quivering ratio
</l>
<l>
To the ecstasy.
</l>
<l>
For each beloved hour
</l>
<l>
Sharp pittances of years,
</l>
<l>
Bitter contested farthings
</l>
<l>
And coffers heaped with tears.

<l>
THROUGH the straight pass of suffering
</l>
<l>
The martyrs even trod,
</l>
<l>
Their feet upon temptation,
</l>
<l>
Their faces upon God.
</l>
<l>
A stately, shriven company;
</l>
<l>
Convulsion playing round, 
</l>
<l>
Harmless as streaks of meteor
</l>
<l>
Upon a planet's bound.
</l>
<l>
Their faith the everlasting troth;
</l>
<l>
Their expectation fair;
</l>
<l>
The needle to the north degree
</l>
<l>
Wades so, through polar air.

<l>
I MEANT to have but modest needs,
</l>
<l>
Such as content, and heaven;
</l>
<l>
Within my income these could lie,
</l>
<l>
And life and I keep even.
</l>
<l>
But since the last included both,
</l>
<l>
It would suffice my prayer
</l>
<l>
But just for one to stipulate,
</l>
<l>
And grace would grant the pair.
</l>
<l>
And so, upon this wise I prayed, —
</l>
<l>
Great Spirit, give to me
</l>
<l>
A heaven not so large as yours,
</l>
<l>
But large enough for me.
</l>
<l>
A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
</l>
<l>
The cherubim withdrew;
</l>
<l>
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
</l>
<l>
And showed their dimples, too.
</l>
<l>
I left the place with all my might, —
</l>
<l>
My prayer away I threw;
</l>
<l>
The quiet ages picked it up,
</l>
<l>
And Judgment twinkled, too,
</l>
<l>
That one so honest be extant
</l>
<l>
As take the tale for true
</l>
<l>
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
</l>
<l>
Itself be given you."
</l>
<l>
But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
</l>
<l>
With a suspicious air, —
</l>
<l>
As children, swindled for the first,
</l>
<l>
All swindlers be, infer.

<l>
THE thought beneath so slight a film
</l>

As laces just reveal the surge,

Or mists the Apennine.

<l>
Secure against its own,

No treason it can fear;

Itself its sovereign, of itself

The soul should stand in awe.

<l>
I  LIKE to see it lap the miles,
</l>

And lick the valleys up,

And then, prodigious, step
</l>
<l>
Around a pile of mountains,
</l>
<l>
And, supercilious, peer
</l>
<l>
In shanties by the sides of roads;
</l>
<l>
And then a quarry pare.
</l>
<l>
To fit its sides, and crawl between,
</l>
<l>
Complaining all the while
</l>
<l>
In horrid, hooting stanza;
</l>
<l>
Then chase itself down hill
</l>
<l>
And neigh like Boanerges;
</l>
<l>
Then, punctual as a star,
</l>
<l>
Stop — docile and omnipotent —
</l>
<l>
At its own stable door.

The mountain at a given distance

The second time to me,

GOD gave a loaf to every bird,

I dare not eat it, though I starve, —

My poignant luxury

Am sovereign of them all.

<l>
MUSICIANS wrestle everywhere:
</l>
<l>
All day, among the crowded air,
</l>
<l>
I hear the silver strife;
</l>
<l>
And — waking long before the dawn —
</l>
<l>
Such transport breaks upon the town
</l>
<l>
I think it that "new life!"
</l>
<l>
It is not bird, it has no nest;
</l>
<l>
Nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
</l>
<l>
Nor tambourine, nor man;
</l>
<l>
It is not hymn from pulpit read, —
</l>
<l>
The morning stars the treble led
</l>
<l>
On time's first afternoon!
</l>
<l>
Some say it is the spheres at play!
</l>
<l>
Some say that bright majority
</l>
<l>
Of vanished dames and men!
</l>

Some think it service in the place

Where we, with late, celestial face,

Please God, shall ascertain!

Just felt the world go by!

Just girt me for the onset with eternity,

When breath blew back,

And on the other side
</l>
<l>
I heard recede the disappointed tide!

Therefore, as one returned, I feel,
</l>
<l>
Odd secrets of the line to tell!

<l>
Some sailor, skirting foreign shores,

<l>
Some pale reporter from the awful doors

Before the seal!

Next time, to stay!
</l>
<l>
Next time, the things to see

By ear unheard,

<l>
Unscrutinized by eye.

Next time, to tarry,

Slow tramp the centuries,

And the cycles wheel.

A different Peru;

For life's estate with you.

Of mines I little know, myself,

But just the names of gems,—

And scarce of diadems

So much that, did I meet the queen,

At least, it solaces to know

That there exists a gold,

Although I prove it just in time

<l>
Its distance to behold!

<l>
It 's far, far treasure to surmise,

Tell him I only said the syntax,

And left the verb and the pronoun out.

<l>
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
</l>
<l>
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
</l>
<l>
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,

<l>
So you could see what moved them so.

<l>
"Tell him it was n't a practised writer,

<l>
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
</l>
<l>
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
</l>
<l>
As if it held but the might of a child;
</l>
<l>
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
</l>
<l>
Tell him — No, you may quibble there,
</l>
<l>
For it would split his heart to know it,
</l>
<l>
And then you and I were silenter.
</l>
<l>
"Tell him night finished before we finished,
</l>
<l>
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'

And you got sleepy and begged to be ended —

What could it hinder so, to say?

Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,

Until to-morrow, — happy letter!

Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"

With but a single star,

Blew out itself for fear.

<l>
The wind pursued the little bush,

And drove away the leaves

November left; then clambered up
</l>
<l>
And fretted in the eaves.

No squirrel went abroad;
</l>
<l>
A dog's belated feet
</l>
<l>
Like intermittent plush were heard

<l>
Adown the empty street.

To feel if blinds be fast,

<l>
And closer to the fire
</l>
<l>
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
</l>
<l>
And shiver for the poor,
</l>
<l>
The housewife's gentle task.

"How pleasanter," said she

Unto the sofa opposite,

"The sleet than May — no thee!"

The sunrise shook from fold,
</l>
<l>
Like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
</l>
<l>
The lady just unrolled.
</l>
<l>
The happy winds their timbrels took;
</l>
<l>
The birds, in docile rows,
</l>
<l>
Arranged themselves around their prince
</l>
<l>
(The wind is prince of those).
</l>
<l>
The orchard sparkled like a Jew, —
</l>
<l>
How mighty 't was, to stay
</l>
<l>
A guest in this stupendous place,
</l>
<l>
The parlor of the day!

THE sun just touched the morning;

The morning, happy thing,

<l>
Supposed that he had come to dwell,

And life would be all spring.
</l>
<l>
She felt herself supremer, —
</l>
<l>
A raised, ethereal thing;

<l>
Henceforth for her what holiday!
</l>
<l>
Meanwhile, her wheeling king
</l>
<l>
Trailed slow along the orchards
</l>
<l>
His haughty, spangled hems,
</l>
<l>
Leaving a new necessity, —
</l>
<l>
The want of diadems!
</l>
<l>
The morning fluttered, staggered,
</l>
<l>
Felt feebly for her crown, —
</l>
<l>
Her unanointed forehead
</l>
<l>
Henceforth her only one.

<l>
FROM cocoon forth a butterfly

Emerged — a summer afternoon —

Repairing everywhere,

Without design, that I could trace,

Except to stray abroad
</l>
<l>
On miscellaneous enterprise

<l>
The clovers understood.

<l>
Her pretty parasol was seen
</l>
<l>
Contracting in a field

<l>
Where men made hay, then struggling hard 
</l>
<l>
With an opposing cloud,
</l>
<l>
Where parties, phantom as herself,
</l>
<l>
To Nowhere seemed to go
</l>
<l>
In purposeless circumference,
</l>
<l>
As 't were a tropic show.
</l>
<l>
And notwithstanding bee that worked,
</l>
<l>
And flower that zealous blew,
</l>
<l>
This audience of idleness
</l>
<l>
Disdained them, from the sky,
</l>
<l>
Till sundown crept, a steady tide,
</l>
<l>
And men that made the hay,
</l>
<l>
And afternoon, and butterfly,
</l>
<l>
Extinguished in its sea.

Inspiriting habiliments

A deeper twilight on the lawn;

Some shook their heads, and others smiled,

"I will inquire again.

So thick upon the plain?"

Meanwhile at many cradles

Humming the quaintest lullaby

"Hush! Epigea wakens!—

They 're here, though; not a creature failed,

In gentle deference to me,

Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment

Of their unthinking drums.

Extended hempen hands,

Aground, upon the sands.

Went past my simple shoe,

And past my bodice too,

<l>
And made as he would eat me up

As wholly as a dew

<l>
Upon a dandelion's sleeve —
</l>
<l>
And then I started too.
</l>
<l>
And he — he followed close behind;
</l>
<l>
I felt his silver heel
</l>
<l>
Upon my ankle, — then my shoes

<l>
Would overflow with pearl.

Until we met the solid town,

No man he seemed to know;

And bowing with a mighty look

At me, the sea withdrew.

Hid heaven and earth from view.

<l>
A floor too cool for corn.

<l>
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
</l>
<l>
I more than once, at morn,
</l>
<l>
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
</l>
<l>
Unbraiding in the sun, —
</l>
<l>
When, stooping to secure it,
</l>
<l>
It wrinkled, and was gone.
</l>
<l>
Several of nature's people
</l>
<l>
I know, and they know me;
</l>
<l>
I feel for them a transport
</l>
<l>
Of cordiality;
</l>
<l>
But never met this fellow,
</l>
<l>
Attended or alone,
</l>
<l>
Without a tighter breathing,
</l>
<l>
And zero at the bone.

<l>
THE mushroom is the elf of plants,
</l>
<l>
At evening it is not;
</l>
<l>
At morning in a truffled hut
</l>
<l>
It stops upon a spot
</l>
<l>
As if it tarried always;
</l>
<l>
And yet its whole career
</l>
<l>
Is shorter than a snake's delay,
</l>
<l>
And fleeter than a tare.
</l>
<l>
'T is vegetation's juggler,
</l>
<l>
The germ of alibi;
</l>
<l>
Doth like a bubble antedate,
</l>
<l>
And like a bubble hie.
</l>
<l>
I feel as if the grass were pleased
</l>
<l>
To have it intermit;
</l>
<l>
The surreptitious scion
</l>
<l>
Of summer's circumspect.
</l>
<l>
Had nature any outcast face,
</l>
<l>
Could she a son contemn,
</l>
<l>
Had nature an Iscariot,
</l>
<l>
That mushroom, — it is him.

<l>
THERE came a wind like a bugle;

It quivered through the grass,

And a green chill upon the heat

So ominous did pass
</l>
<l>
We barred the windows and the doors
</l>
<l>
As from an emerald ghost;
</l>
<l>
The doom's electric moccason
</l>
<l>
That very instant passed.
</l>
<l>
On a strange mob of panting trees,
</l>
<l>
And fences fled away,
</l>
<l>
And rivers where the houses ran
</l>
<l>
The living looked that day.
</l>
<l>
The bell within the steeple wild
</l>
<l>
The flying tidings whirled.
</l>
<l>
How much can come
</l>
<l>
And much can go,
</l>
<l>
And yet abide the world!

But when the south wind stirs the pools

And struggles in the lanes,

<l>
Her heart misgives her for her vow,

And she pours soft refrains

Into the lap of adamant,

My residence within

A rapid, footless guest,

To offer whom a chair

<l>
No bone had he to bind him,

<l>
Of numerous humming-birds at once
</l>
<l>
From a superior bush.
</l>
<l>
His countenance a billow,
</l>
<l>
His fingers, if he pass,
</l>
<l>
Let go a music, as of tunes
</l>
<l>
Blown tremulous in glass.
</l>
<l>
He visited, still flitting;
</l>
<l>
Then, like a timid man,
</l>
<l>
Again he tapped — 't was flurriedly —
</l>
<l>
And I became alone.

<l>
IT sifts from leaden sieves,
</l>
<l>
It powders all the wood,
</l>
<l>
It fills with alabaster wool
</l>
<l>
The wrinkles of the road.
</l>
<l>
It makes an even face
</l>
<l>
Of mountain and of plain, —
</l>
<l>
Unbroken forehead from the east
</l>
<l>
Unto the east again.
</l>
<l>
It reaches to the fence,
</l>
<l>
It wraps it, rail by rail,
</l>
<l>
Till it is lost in fleeces;
</l>
<l>
It flings a crystal veil
</l>
<l>
On stump and stack and stem, —
</l>
<l>
The summer's empty room,
</l>
<l>
Acres of seams where harvests were,
</l>
<l>
Recordless, but for them.
</l>
<l>
It ruffles wrists of posts,
</l>
<l>
As ankles of a queen, —
</l>
<l>
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,
</l>
<l>
Denying they have been.

<l>
NO brigadier throughout the year
</l>
<l>
So civic as the jay.
</l>
<l>
A neighbor and a warrior too,
</l>
<l>
With shrill felicity
</l>
<l>
Pursuing winds that censure us
</l>
<l>
A February day,
</l>
<l>
The brother of the universe
</l>
<l>
Was never blown away.
</l>
<l>
The snow and he are intimate;
</l>
<l>
I 've often seen them play
</l>
<l>
When heaven looked upon us all
</l>
<l>
With such severity,
</l>
<l>
I felt apology were due
</l>
<l>
To an insulted sky,
</l>
<l>
Whose pompous frown was nutriment
</l>
<l>
To their temerity.
</l>
<l>
The pillow of this daring head
</l>
<l>
Is pungent evergreens;
</l>
<l>
His larder — terse and militant —
</l>
<l>
Unknown, refreshing things;
</l>
<l>
His character a tonic,
</l>
<l>
His future a dispute;
</l>
<l>
Unfair an immortality
</l>
<l>
That leaves this neighbor out.

Was dressed in mechlin, — so;

He wore no sandal on his foot,

And stepped like flakes of snow.
</l>
<l>
His gait was soundless, like the bird,
</l>
<l>
 But rapid, like the roe;
</l>
<l>
His fashions quaint, mosaic,
</l>
<l>
Or, haply, mistletoe.
</l>
<l>
His conversation seldom,
</l>
<l>
His laughter like the breeze
</l>
<l>
That dies away in dimples
</l>
<l>
Among the pensive trees.
</l>
<l>
Our interview was transient,—

And God forbid I look behind

Since that appalling day!

Be its mattress straight,

Let no sunrise' yellow noise

Interrupt this ground.

<l>
ON such a night, or such a night,
</l>
<l>
Would anybody care
</l>
<l>
If such a little figure
</l>
<l>
Slipped quiet from its chair,
</l>
<l>
So quiet, oh, how quiet!
</l>
<l>
That nobody might know
</l>
<l>
But that the little figure
</l>
<l>
Rocked softer, to and fro?
</l>
<l>
On such a dawn, or such a dawn,
</l>
<l>
Would anybody sigh
</l>
<l>
That such a little figure
</l>
<l>
Too sound asleep did lie
</l>
<l>
For chanticleer to wake it, —
</l>
<l>
Or stirring house below,
</l>
<l>
Or giddy bird in orchard,
</l>
<l>
Or early task to do?
</l>
<l>
There was a little figure plump
</l>
<l>
For every little knoll,
</l>
<l>
Busy needles, and spools of thread,
</l>
<l>
And trudging feet from school.
</l>
<l>
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
</l>
<l>
And visions vast and small.
</l>
<l>
Strange that the feet so precious charged
</l>
<l>
Should reach so small a goal!

Developed from within, —

When Death lit all the shortness up,

And made the hurry plain.

We wondered at our blindness, —

When nothing was to see

At our stupidity,

The busy darling lay,

So busy was she, finishing,

<l>
So leisurely were we!

Far safer, of a midnight meeting

 External ghost,

That whiter host.

<l>
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,

The stones achase,

Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
</l>
<l>
In lonesome place.

Ourself, behind ourself concealed,

Should startle most;

<l>
Assassin, hid in our apartment,

Be horror's least.

He bolts the door,

O'erlooking a superior spectre

More near.

Took up her simple wardrobe

And started for the sun.

WENT up a year this evening!

Amid no bells nor bravos

Cheerful, as to the village,

<l>
Tranquil, as to repose,

<l>
Chastened, as to the chapel,
</l>
<l>
This humble tourist rose.
</l>
<l>
Did not talk of returning,

Alluded to no time

When, were the gales propitious,

We might look for him;
</l>
<l>
Was grateful for the roses

<l>
In life's diverse bouquet,
</l>
<l>
Talked softly of new species
</l>
<l>
To pick another day.
</l>
<l>
Beguiling thus the wonder,
</l>
<l>
The wondrous nearer drew;
</l>
<l>
Hands bustled at the moorings —
</l>
<l>
The crowd respectful grew.
</l>
<l>
Ascended from our vision
</l>
<l>
To countenances new!

A difference, a daisy,

<l>
Is all the rest I knew!

Who marshalled her away.

One little maid from playmates,

<l>
One little mind from school, —

There must be guests in Eden;

All the rooms are full.

Our departed are.

Put out their tongues, for noon.

It was not frost, for on my flesh

I felt siroccos crawl, —

Nor fire, for just my marble feet

Could keep a chancel cool.

The figures I have seen

Set orderly, for burial,

Reminded me of mine,

And fitted to a frame,

And could not breathe without a key;

And 't was like midnight, some,

When everything that ticked has stopped,

And space stares, all around,

Repeal the beating ground.

But most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —

Without a chance or spar,

Or even a report of land

<l>
To justify despair.

Because — because if he should die

While I was gone, and I — too late —

<l>
Should reach the heart that wanted me;

If I should disappoint the eyes

That hunted, hunted so, to see,

And could not bear to shut until

So sure I 'd come — so sure I 'd come,

It listening, listening, went to sleep

Telling my tardy name, —

My heart would wish it broke before,

Since breaking then, since breaking then,

Were useless as next morning's sun,

Where midnight frosts had lain!
