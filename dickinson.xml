<l>
THIS is my letter to the world,
</l>
<l>
 That never wrote to me,— 
</l>
<l>
 The simple news that nature told, 
</l>
<l>
 With tender magesty. 
</l>
<l>
Her message is committed
</l>
<l>
To hands I cannot see;
</l>
<l>
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
</l>
<l>
Judge tenderly of me!

<l>
SUCCESS is counted sweetest
</l>
<l>
By those who ne'er succeed.
</l>
<l>
To comprehend a nectar
</l>
<l>
Requires sorest need.
</l>
<l>
Not one of all the purple host
</l>
<l>
Who took the flag to-day
</l>
<l>
Can tell the definition,
</l>
<l>
So clear, of victory,
</l>
<l>
As he, defeated, dying,
</l>
<l>
On whose forbidden ear
</l>
<l>
The distant strains of triumph
</l>
<l>
Break, agonized and clear.

<l>
OUR share of night to bear,
</l>
<l>
Our share of morning,
</l>
<l>
Our blank in bliss to fill,
</l>
<l>
Our blank in scorning.
</l>
<l>
Here a star, and there a star,
</l>
<l>
Some lose their way.
</l>
<l>
Here a mist, and there a mist,

<l>
Afterwards — day!

<l>
SOUL, wilt thou toss again?
</l>
<l>
By just such a hazard
</l>
<l>
Hundreds have lost, indeed,
</l>
<l>
But tens have won an all.
</l>
<l>
Angels' breathless ballot

'T IS so much joy! 'T is so much joy!

And yet, as poor as I

<l>
Have ventured all upon a throw;
</l>
<l>
Have gained! Yes!            Hesitated so

<l>
This side the victory!

Life is but life, and death but death!

<l>
Bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath!

And if. indeed, I fail,

<l>
At least to know the worst is sweet.

Defeat means nothing but defeat,

GLEE! the great storm is over!

Four have recovered the land;

<l>
Forty gone down together

Into the boiling sand.
</l>
<l>
Ring, for the scant salvation!
</l>
<l>
Toll, for the bonnie souls, —
</l>
<l>
Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
</l>
<l>
Spinning upon the shoals!
</l>
<l>
How they will tell the shipwreck
</l>
<l>
When winter shakes the door,
</l>
<l>
Till the children ask, "But the forty?
</l>
<l>
Did they come back no more?"
</l>
<l>
Then a silence suffuses the story,
</l>
<l>
And a softness the teller's eye;
</l>
<l>
And the children no further question.
</l>
<l>
And only the waves reply.

Soft sauntered through the village,

Sauntered as soft away!
</l>

So unsuspected violets

Within the fields lie low,

Too late for striving fingers

That passed, an hour ago.

'T is but the ecstasy of death,

And then the brake is still.

The smitten rock that gushes,

A cheek is always redder

<l>
A PRECIOUS, mouldering pleasure 't is
</l>
<l>
To meet an antique book,
</l>
<l>
In just the dress his century wore;
</l>
<l>
A privilege, I think,
</l>
<l>
His venerable hand to take,
</l>
<l>
And warming in our own,
</l>
<l>
A passage back, or two, to make
</l>
<l>
To times when he was young.
</l>
<l>
His quaint opinions to inspect,
</l>
<l>
His knowledge to unfold
</l>
<l>
On what concerns our mutual mind,
</l>
<l>
The literature of old;
</l>
<l>
What interested scholars most,
</l>
<l>
What competitions ran
</l>
<l>
When Plato was a certainty,
</l>
<l>
And Sophocles a man;
</l>
<l>
When Sappho was a living girl,
</l>
<l>
And Beatrice wore
</l>
<l>
The gown that Dante deified.
</l>
<l>
Facts, centuries before,
</l>
<l>
He traverses familiar,
</l>
<l>
As one should come to town
</l>
<l>
And tell you all your dreams were true:
</l>
<l>
He lived where dreams were sown.
</l>
<l>
His presence is enchantment,
</l>
<l>
You beg him not to go;
</l>
<l>
Old volumes shake their vellum heads
</l>
<l>
And tantalize, just so.

THE soul selects her own society,

On her divine majority

Obtrude no more.
</l>
<l>
Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
</l>
<l>
At her low gate;
</l>
<l>
Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
</l>
<l>
Upon her mat.
</l>
<l>
I've known her from an ample nation
</l>
<l>
Choose one;
</l>
<l>
Then close the valves of her attention

Like stone.

Some things that stay there be, —

Grief, hills, eternity:

<poem id="AB8" publisher="Boston: Roberts Brothers" year="1891" title="XV. THE LONELY HOUSE.">
<l>
I KNOW some lonely houses off the road
</l>
<l>
A robber 'd like the look of,—
</l>
<l>
Wooden barred,
</l>
<l>
And windows hanging low,
</l>
<l>
Inviting to
</l>
<l>
A portico,
</l>
<l>
Where two could creep:
</l>
<l>
One hand the tools,
</l>
<l>
The other peep
</l>
<l>
To make sure all's asleep.
</l>
<l>
Old-fashioned eyes,
</l>
<l>
Not easy to surprise!
</l>
<l>
How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,
</l>
<l>
With just a clock,—
</l>
<l>
But they could gag the tick,
</l>
<l>
And mice won't bark;
</l>
<l>
And so the walls don't tell,
</l>
<l>
None will.
</l>
<l>
A pair of spectacles afar just stir —
</l>
<l>
An almanac's aware.
</l>
<l>
Was it the mat winked,
</l>
<l>
Or a nervous star?
</l>
<l>
The moon slides down the stair
</l>
<l>
To see who's there.
</l>
<l>
There's plunder, — where?
</l>
<l>
Tankard, or spoon,
</l>
<l>
Earring, or stone,
</l>
<l>
A watch, some ancient brooch
</l>
<l>
To match the grandmamma,
</l>
<l>
Staid sleeping there.
</l>
<l>
Day rattles, too,
</l>
<l>
Stealth's slow;
</l>
<l>
The sun has got as far
</l>
<l>
As the third sycamore.
</l>
<l>
Screams chanticleer,
</l>
<l>
"Who's there?"
</l>
<l>
And echoes, trains away,
</l>
<l>
Sneer— " Where?"
</l>
<l>
While the old couple, just astir,
</l>
<l>
Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!

<l>
TO fight aloud is very brave,
</l>
<l>
But gallanter, I know,

<l>
Who charge within the bosom,
</l>

The cavalry of woe.
</l>
<l>
Who win, and nations do not see,
</l>
<l>
Who fall, and none observe,
</l>
<l>
Whose dying eyes no country

<l>
Regards with patriot love.
</l>
<l>
We trust, in plumed procession,

Rank after rank, with even feet

The faithful witness,

<l>
Till we are helped,

As if a kingdom cared!

<l>
Read then of faith

<l>
That shone above the fagot;

<l>
Clear strains of hymn

The river could not drown;

Brave names of men

And celestial women,

<l>
Passed out of record

Into renown!

<l>
PAIN has an element of blank;
</l>
<l>
It cannot recollect

<l>
When it began, or if there were
</l>
<l>
A day when it was not.
</l>

It has no future but itself,

Its infinite realms contain

Its past, enlightened to perceive

New periods of pain.

HAVE you got a brook in your little heart,

Where bashful flowers blow,

<l>
And blushing birds go down to drink,
</l>
<l>
And shadows tremble so?
</l>
<l>
And nobody knows, so still it flows,
</l>
<l>
That any brook is there;
</l>
<l>
And yet your little draught of life
</l>
<l>
Is daily drunken there.
</l>

Then look out for the little brook in March,
</l>
<l>
When the rivers overflow,
</l>

And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
</l>
<l>
And the bridges often go.
</l>
<l>
And later, in August it may be,
</l>

When the meadows parching lie,

Beware, lest this little brook of life

Some burning noon go dry!

Entirely for me;

I thought that such were for the saints,
</l>
<l>
Where revelations be.
</l>
<l>
The sun, as common, went abroad,
</l>
<l>
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
</l>
<l>
As if no soul the solstice passed
</l>
<l>
That maketh all things new.
</l>
<l>
The time was scarce profaned by speech;
</l>
<l>
The symbol of a word
</l>
<l>
Was needless, as at sacrament
</l>
<l>
The wardrobe of our Lord.
</l>
<l>
Each was to each the sealed church,
</l>
<l>
Permitted to commune this time,
</l>
<l>
Lest we too awkward show
</l>
<l>
At supper of the Lamb.
</l>
<l>
The hours slid fast, as hours will,
</l>
<l>
Clutched tight by greedy hands;
</l>
<l>
So faces on two decks look back,
</l>
<l>
Bound to opposing lands.
</l>
<l>
And so, when all the time had failed,
</l>
<l>
Without external sound,
</l>
<l>
Each bound the other's crucifix,
</l>
<l>
We gave no other bond.
</l>
<l>
Sufficient troth that we shall rise—
</l>
<l>
Deposed, at length, the grave—
</l>
<l>
To that new marriage, justified
</l>
<l>
Through Calvaries of Love!

My second rank, too small the first,

Crowned, crowing on my father's breast,

In sovereign, swerveless tune.

Surrendering the last,

When cancelled by the frost.

His breast, a single onyx

Then lightly as a reed

Bent to the water, shivered scarce,

<l>
Consented, and was dead.

HOPE is the thing with feathers

And sore must be the storm

That kept so many warm.

I 've heard it in the chillest land,

And on the strangest sea;

<l>
Yet, never, in extremity,
</l>
<l>
It asked a crumb of me.

DARE you see a soul at the white heat?

Red is the fire's common tint;

But when the vivid ore
</l>
<l>
Has sated flame's conditions,
</l>
<l>
Its quivering substance plays
</l>
<l>
Without a color but the light
</l>
<l>
Of unanointed blaze.
</l>
<l>
Least village boasts its blacksmith,
</l>
<l>
Whose anvil's even din
</l>
<l>
Stands symbol for the finer forge

That soundless tugs within,

Refining these impatient ores
</l>
<l>
With hammer and with blaze,

Until the designated light

<l>
Repudiate the forge.

<l>
I MEANT to have but modest needs,
</l>
<l>
Such as content, and heaven;
</l>
<l>
Within my income these could lie,
</l>
<l>
And life and I keep even.
</l>
<l>
But since the last included both,
</l>
<l>
It would suffice my prayer
</l>
<l>
But just for one to stipulate,
</l>
<l>
And grace would grant the pair.
</l>
<l>
And so, upon this wise I prayed, —
</l>
<l>
Great Spirit, give to me
</l>
<l>
A heaven not so large as yours,
</l>
<l>
But large enough for me.
</l>
<l>
A smile suffused Jehovah's face;
</l>
<l>
The cherubim withdrew;
</l>
<l>
Grave saints stole out to look at me,
</l>
<l>
And showed their dimples, too.
</l>
<l>
I left the place with all my might, —
</l>
<l>
My prayer away I threw;
</l>
<l>
The quiet ages picked it up,
</l>
<l>
And Judgment twinkled, too,
</l>
<l>
That one so honest be extant
</l>
<l>
As take the tale for true
</l>
<l>
That "Whatsoever you shall ask,
</l>
<l>
Itself be given you."
</l>
<l>
But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies
</l>
<l>
With a suspicious air, —
</l>
<l>
As children, swindled for the first,
</l>
<l>
All swindlers be, infer.

In shanties by the sides of roads;

Stop — docile and omnipotent —

<l>
A SHADY friend for torrid days
</l>
<l>
Is easier to find
</l>
<l>
Than one of higher temperature
</l>
<l>
For frigid hour of mind.
</l>
<l>
The vane a little to the east
</l>
<l>
Scares muslin souls away;
</l>
<l>
If broadcloth breasts are firmer
</l>
<l>
Than those of organdy,
</l>
<l>
Who is to blame? The weaver?
</l>
<l>
Ah! the bewildering thread!
</l>
<l>
The tapestries of paradise
</l>
<l>
So notelessly are made!

<l>
EACH life converges to some centre
</l>
<l>
Expressed or still;
</l>
<l>
Exists in every human nature
</l>
<l>
A goal,
</l>
<l>
Admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
</l>
<l>
Too fair
</l>
<l>
For credibility's temerity
</l>
<l>
To dare.
</l>
<l>
Adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
</l>
<l>
To reach
</l>
<l>
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment
</l>
<l>
To touch,
</l>
<l>
Yet persevered toward, surer for the distance;
</l>
<l>
How high
</l>
<l>
Unto the saints' slow diligence
</l>
<l>
The sky!
</l>
<l>
Ungained, it may be, by a life's low venture,
</l>
<l>
But then,
</l>
<l>
Eternity enables the endeavoring
</l>
<l>
Again.

<l>
BEFORE I got my eye put out,
</l>
<l>
I liked as well to see
</l>
<l>
As other creatures that have eyes,
</l>
<l>
And know no other way.
</l>
<l>
But were it told to me, to-day,
</l>
<l>
That I might have the sky
</l>
<l>
For mine, I tell you that my heart
</l>
<l>
Would split, for size of me.
</l>
<l>
The meadows mine, the mountains mine, —
</l>
<l>
All forests, stintless stars,
</l>
<l>
As much of noon as I could take
</l>
<l>
Between my finite eyes.
</l>
<l>
The motions of the dipping birds,
</l>
<l>
The lightning's jointed road,
</l>
<l>
For mine to look at when I liked, —
</l>
<l>
The news would strike me dead!
</l>
<l>
So safer, guess, with just my soul
</l>
<l>
Upon the window-pane
</l>
<l>
Where other creatures put their eyes,
</l>
<l>
Incautious of the sun.

HEART not so heavy as mine,

Wending late home,

As it passed my window

A careless snatch, a ballad,

Yet to my irritated ear

An anodyne so sweet,

It was as if a bobolink,

<l>
Sauntering this way,

Carolled and mused and carolled,

Then bubbled slow away.

<l>
It was as if a chirping brook

Upon a toilsome way

<l>
Set bleeding feet to minuets

Without the knowing why.

And touched the curious wine.

'T was this on tables I had seen,

When turning, hungry, lone,

I looked in windows, for the wealth

<l>
I could not hope to own.
</l>
<l>
I did not know the ample bread,
</l>
<l>
'T was so unlike the crumb
</l>
<l>
The birds and I had often shared
</l>
<l>
In Nature's dining-room.
</l>
<l>
The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, —
</l>
<l>
Myself felt ill and odd,
</l>
<l>
As berry of a mountain bush
</l>
<l>
Transplanted to the road.
</l>
<l>
Nor was I hungry; so I found
</l>
<l>
That hunger was a way
</l>
<l>
Of persons outside windows,
</l>
<l>
The entering takes away.

And now, before the door,

I never saw before

Stare vacant into mine

And ask my business there.

My business, — just a life I left,

Was such still dwelling there?

I fumbled at my nerve,

I scanned the windows near;

<l>
The silence like an ocean rolled,
</l>
<l>
And broke against my ear.
</l>
<l>
I laughed a wooden laugh
</l>
<l>
That I could fear a door,
</l>
<l>
Who danger and the dead had faced,
</l>
<l>
But never quaked before.
</l>
<l>
I fitted to the latch
</l>
<l>
My hand, with trembling care,
</l>
<l>
Lest back the awful door should spring,
</l>
<l>
And leave me standing there.
</l>
<l>
I moved my fingers off
</l>
<l>
As cautiously as glass,
</l>
<l>
And held my ears, and like a thief
</l>
<l>
Fled gasping from the house.

<l>
To lead it here;
</l>
<l>
Nor any death, but lest
</l>
<l>
Dispelled from there;
</l>
<l>
Nor tie to earths to come,
</l>
<l>
Nor action new,
</l>
<l>
Except through this extent,
</l>
<l>
The realm of you.

<l>
YOUR riches taught me poverty.
</l>
<l>
Myself a millionnaire
</l>
<l>
In little wealths, — as girls could boast, —
</l>
<l>
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,
</l>
<l>
You drifted your dominions
</l>
<l>
A different Peru;
</l>
<l>
And I esteemed all poverty,
</l>
<l>
For life's estate with you.
</l>
<l>
Of mines I little know, myself,
</l>
<l>
But just the names of gems,—
</l>
<l>
The colors of the commonest;
</l>
<l>
And scarce of diadems
</l>
<l>
So much that, did I meet the queen,
</l>
<l>
Her glory I should know:
</l>
<l>
But this must be a different wealth,
</l>
<l>
To miss it beggars so.
</l>
<l>
I 'm sure 't is India all day
</l>
<l>
To those who look on you
</l>
<l>
Without a stint, without a blame, —
</l>
<l>
Might I but be the Jew!
</l>
<l>
I 'm sure it is Golconda,
</l>
<l>
Beyond my power to deem, —
</l>
<l>
To have a smile for mine each day,
</l>
<l>
How better than a gem!
</l>
<l>
At least, it solaces to know
</l>
<l>
That there exists a gold,
</l>
<l>
Although I prove it just in time
</l>
<l>
Its distance to behold!
</l>
<l>
It 's far, far treasure to surmise,
</l>
<l>
And estimate the pearl
</l>
<l>
That slipped my simple fingers through
</l>
<l>
While just a girl at school!

<l>
I GAVE myself to him,
</l>
<l>
And took himself for pay.
</l>
<l>
The solemn contract of a life
</l>
<l>
Was ratified this way.
</l>
<l>
The wealth might disappoint,
</l>
<l>
Myself a poorer prove

<l>

The daily own of Love

Depreciate the vision;

<l>
Still fable, in the isles of spice,

The subtle cargoes lie.

<l>
At least,'t is mutual risk, —
</l>
<l>
Some found it mutual gain;
</l>

Sweet debt of Life, — each night to owe,

<l>
Insolvent, every noon.

"GOING to him! Happy letter! Tell him —
</l>
<l>
Tell him the page I did n't write;
</l>
<l>
Tell him I only said the syntax,
</l>
<l>
And left the verb and the pronoun out.
</l>
<l>
Tell him just how the fingers hurried,
</l>
<l>
Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;
</l>
<l>
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
</l>
<l>
So you could see what moved them so.
</l>
<l>
"Tell him it was n't a practised writer,
</l>
<l>
You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;
</l>
<l>
You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
</l>
<l>
As if it held but the might of a child;
</l>
<l>
You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.
</l>
<l>
Tell him — No, you may quibble there,
</l>
<l>
For it would split his heart to know it,
</l>
<l>
And then you and I were silenter.
</l>
<l>
"Tell him night finished before we finished,
</l>
<l>
And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'
</l>
<l>
And you got sleepy and begged to be ended —
</l>
<l>
What could it hinder so, to say?
</l>
<l>
Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
</l>
<l>
But if he ask where you are hid
</l>
<l>
Until to-morrow, — happy letter!

<l>
Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"

<l>
For transport it be sure.

And then I go the furthest off

<l>
To counteract a knock;

Then draw my little letter forth
</l>
<l>
And softly pick its lock.

<l>
Then, glancing narrow at the wall,

And narrow at the floor,

Not exorcised before,

Peruse how infinite I am

With but a single star,

That often as a cloud it met

Blew out itself for fear.
</l>
<l>
The wind pursued the little bush,

And drove away the leaves

November left; then clambered up
</l>
<l>
And fretted in the eaves.
</l>
<l>
No squirrel went abroad;
</l>
<l>
A dog's belated feet
</l>
<l>
Like intermittent plush were heard
</l>
<l>
Adown the empty street.

<l>
To feel if blinds be fast,
</l>
<l>
And closer to the fire
</l>
<l>
Her little rocking-chair to draw,
</l>
<l>
And shiver for the poor,
</l>
<l>
The housewife's gentle task.
</l>

"How pleasanter," said she

<l>
Unto the sofa opposite,

"The sleet than May — no thee!"

Did stagger pitiful.

Her fingers fumbled at her work, —

Without a single leaf,

<l>
And shouts for joy to nobody

<l>
But his seraphic self!

<l>
AN altered look about the hills;
</l>
<l>
A Tyrian light the village fills;
</l>
<l>
A wider sunrise in the dawn;
</l>
<l>
A deeper twilight on the lawn;
</l>
<l>
A print of a vermilion foot;
</l>
<l>
A purple finger on the slope;
</l>
<l>
A flippant fly upon the pane;    
</l>
<l>
A spider at his trade again;
</l>
<l>
An added strut in chanticleer;
</l>
<l>
A flower expected everywhere;
</l>
<l>
An axe shrill singing in the woods;
</l>
<l>
Fern-odors on untravelled roads, —
</l>
<l>
All this, and more I cannot tell,
</l>
<l>
A furtive look you know as well,
</l>
<l>
And Nicodemus' mystery
</l>
<l>
Receives its annual reply.

"WHOSE are the little beds," I asked, 
</l>
<l>
"Which in the valleys lie?"
</l>
<l>
Some shook their heads, and others smiled,
</l>
<l>
And no one made reply.
</l>
<l>
"Perhaps they did not hear," I said;
</l>
<l>
"I will inquire again.
</l>
<l>
Whose are the beds, the tiny beds
</l>
<l>
So thick upon the plain?"
</l>
<l>
"'T is daisy in the shortest;

<l>
A little farther on,

Nearest the door to wake the first,

"'T is iris, sir, and aster,

Anemone and bell,

Batschia in the blanket red,

<l>
And chubby daffodil."
</l>
<l>
Meanwhile at many cradles 
</l>
<l>
Her busy foot she plied,
</l>
<l>
Humming the quaintest lullaby
</l>
<l>
That ever rocked a child.
</l>
<l>
"Hush! Epigea wakens!—
</l>
<l>
The crocus stirs her lids,

Rhodora's cheek is crimson, —

She's dreaming of the woods."

<l>
Then, turning from them, reverent,

"Their bed-time 't is," she said;

"The bumble-bees will wake them

<l>
When April woods are red."

He hurts a little, though.

I dared not meet the daffodils,

They 're here, though; not a creature failed,

Upon a shining sea, —

<l>
I STARTED early, took my dog,
</l>
<l>
And visited the sea;
</l>
<l>
The mermaids in the basement
</l>
<l>
Came out to look at me,
</l>
<l>
And frigates in the upper floor
</l>
<l>
Extended hempen hands,
</l>
<l>
Presuming me to be a mouse
</l>
<l>
Aground, upon the sands.
</l>
<l>
But no man moved me till the tide
</l>
<l>
Went past my simple shoe,
</l>
<l>
And past my apron and my belt,
</l>
<l>
And past my bodice too,
</l>
<l>
And made as he would eat me up
</l>
<l>
As wholly as a dew
</l>
<l>
Upon a dandelion's sleeve —
</l>
<l>
And then I started too.
</l>
<l>
And he — he followed close behind;
</l>
<l>
I felt his silver heel
</l>
<l>
Upon my ankle, — then my shoes
</l>
<l>
Would overflow with pearl.
</l>
<l>
Until we met the solid town,
</l>
<l>
No man he seemed to know;
</l>
<l>
And bowing with a mighty look
</l>
<l>
At me, the sea withdrew.

A monster with a glass

Computes the stamens in a breath,

Hid heaven and earth from view.

The creatures chuckled on the roofs

And whistled in the air,

And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth,

He bit an angle-worm in halves

And ate the fellow, raw.

And then he drank a dew

<l>
From a convenient grass,

<l>
And then hopped sidewise to the wall
</l>
<l>
To let a beetle pass.

He glanced with rapid eyes

That hurried all abroad, —

They looked like frightened beads, I thought;

He stirred his velvet head

Like one in danger; cautious,

I offered him a crumb,

And he unrolled his feathers

And rowed him softer home

<l>
Than oars divide the ocean,

Too silver for a seam,

Leap, plashless, as they swim.

<l>
The grass divides as with a comb,
</l>
<l>
A spotted shaft is seen;
</l>
<l>
And then it closes at your feet
</l>
<l>
And opens further on.
</l>
<l>
He likes a boggy acre,
</l>
<l>
A floor too cool for corn.
</l>
<l>
Yet when a child, and barefoot,
</l>
<l>
I more than once, at morn,
</l>
<l>
Have passed, I thought, a whip-lash
</l>
<l>
Unbraiding in the sun, —
</l>
<l>
When, stooping to secure it,
</l>
<l>
It wrinkled, and was gone.

Several of nature's people

<l>
I know, and they know me;

Of cordiality;

Attended or alone,

Without a tighter breathing,

And zero at the bone.

THE one that could repeat the summer day

<l>
Were greater than itself, though he
</l>
<l>
Minutest of mankind might be.

And who could reproduce the sun,

<l>
At period of going down —
</l>
<l>
The lingering and the stain, I mean —
</l>
<l>
When Orient has been outgrown,

And Occident becomes unknown,

<l>
THE wind tapped like a tired man,
</l>
<l>
And like a host, "Come in,"
</l>
<l>
I boldly answered; entered then
</l>
<l>
My residence within
</l>
<l>
A rapid, footless guest,
</l>
<l>
To offer whom a chair
</l>
<l>
Were as impossible as hand
</l>
<l>
A sofa to the air.
</l>
<l>
No bone had he to bind him,
</l>
<l>
His speech was like the push
</l>
<l>
Of numerous humming-birds at once
</l>
<l>
From a superior bush.
</l>
<l>
His countenance a billow,
</l>
<l>
His fingers, if he pass,
</l>
<l>
Let go a music, as of tunes
</l>
<l>
Blown tremulous in glass.
</l>
<l>
He visited, still flitting;
</l>
<l>
Then, like a timid man,
</l>
<l>
Again he tapped — 't was flurriedly —
</l>
<l>
And I became alone.

<l>
NATURE rarer uses yellow

</l>
<l>
Spending scarlet like a woman,

<l>
Yellow she affords
</l>

Only scantly and selectly,

And awe was all we could feel.

By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,

He flung a menace at the earth,

A menace at the sky.

<l>
The leaves unhooked themselves from trees
</l>
<l>
And started all abroad;
</l>
<l>
The dust did scoop itself like hands
</l>
<l>
And throw away the road.
</l>
<l>
The wagons quickened on the streets,
</l>
<l>
The thunder hurried slow;
</l>
<l>
The lightning showed a yellow beak,
</l>
<l>
And then a livid claw.
</l>
<l>
The birds put up the bars to nests,
</l>
<l>
The cattle fled to barns;
</l>
<l>
There came one drop of giant rain,

<l>
And then, as if the hands

<l>
That held the dams had parted hold,

The waters wrecked the sky,

But overlooked my father's house,

Just quartering a tree.

Antiquest felt at noon

A quietness distilled,

Or Nature, spending with herself

Sequestered afternoon.

As guest who would be gone.

And thus, without a wing,

<l>
Or service of a keel,

Into the beautiful.

<l>
ONE need not be a chamber to be haunted,
</l>
<l>
One need not be a house;
</l>
<l>
The brain has corridors surpassing

Material place.
</l>
<l>
Far safer, of a midnight meeting
</l>
<l>
 External ghost,
</l>
<l>
Than an interior confronting
</l>
<l>
That whiter host.
</l>
<l>
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
</l>
<l>
The stones achase,
</l>
<l>
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
</l>
<l>
In lonesome place.
</l>
<l>
Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
</l>
<l>
Should startle most;
</l>
<l>
Assassin, hid in our apartment,
</l>
<l>
Be horror's least.
</l>
<l>
The prudent carries a revolver,
</l>
<l>
He bolts the door,
</l>
<l>
O'erlooking a superior spectre
</l>
<l>
More near.

SHE died, — this was the way she died;

Took up her simple wardrobe

And started for the sun.

Tranquil, as to repose,

Chastened, as to the chapel,

This humble tourist rose.

Did not talk of returning,

Was grateful for the roses

<l>
Talked softly of new species

<l>
To pick another day.

<l>
Beguiling thus the wonder,

<l>
The wondrous nearer drew;
</l>
<l>
Hands bustled at the moorings —
</l>
<l>
The crowd respectful grew.
</l>
<l>
Ascended from our vision

A difference, a daisy,

<l>
I HAD a guinea golden;
</l>
<l>
I lost it in the sand,
</l>
<l>
And though the sum was simple,
</l>
<l>
And pounds were in the land,
</l>
<l>
Still had it such a value
</l>
<l>
Unto my frugal eye,
</l>
<l>
That when I could not find it
</l>
<l>
I sat me down to sigh. 
</l>
<l>
I had a crimson robin
</l>
<l>
Who sang full many a day,
</l>
<l>
But when the woods were painted
</l>
<l>
He, too, did fly away.
</l>
<l>
Time brought me other robins, —
</l>
<l>
Their ballads were the same, —
</l>
<l>
Still for my missing troubadour
</l>
<l>
I kept the 'house at hame.' 
</l>
<l>
I had a star in heaven;
</l>
<l>
One Pleiad was its name,
</l>
<l>
And when I was not heeding
</l>
<l>
It wandered from the same.
</l>
<l>
And though the skies are crowded,
</l>
<l>
And all the night ashine,
</l>
<l>
I do not care about it,
</l>
<l>
Since none of them are mine.
</l>
<l>
My story has a moral:
</l>
<l>
I have a missing friend, —
</l>
<l>
Pleiad its name, and robin,
</l>
<l>
And guinea in the sand, —
</l>
<l>
And when this mournful ditty,
</l>
<l>
Accompanied with tear,
</l>
<l>
Shall meet the eye of traitor
</l>
<l>
In country far from here,
</l>
<l>
Grant that repentance solemn
</l>
<l>
May seize upon his mind,
</l>
<l>
And he no consolation
</l>
<l>
Beneath the sun may find.

<l>
I MEASURE every grief I meet
</l>
<l>
With analytic eyes;
</l>
<l>
I wonder if it weighs like mine,
</l>
<l>
Or has an easier size.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if they bore it long,
</l>
<l>
Or did it just begin?
</l>
<l>
I could not tell the date of mine,
</l>
<l>
It feels so old a pain.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if it hurts to live,
</l>
<l>
And if they have to try,
</l>
<l>
And whether, could they choose between,
</l>
<l>
They would not rather die.
</l>
<l>
I wonder if when years have piled —
</l>
<l>
Some thousands — on the cause
</l>
<l>
Of early  hurt, if such a lapse 
</l>
<l>
Could give them any pause;
</l>
<l>
Or would they go on aching still
</l>
<l>
Through centuries above,
</l>
<l>
Enlightened to a larger pain
</l>
<l>
By contrast with the love.
</l>
<l>
The grieved are many, I am told;
</l>
<l>
The reason deeper lies, —
</l>
<l>
Death is but one and comes but once,
</l>
<l>
And only nails the eyes.
</l>
<l>
There's grief of want, and grief of cold, —
</l>
<l>
A sort they call 'despair;'
</l>
<l>
There's banishment from native eyes,
</l>
<l>
In sight of native air.
</l>
<l>
And though I may not guess the kind
</l>
<l>
Correctly, yet to me
</l>
<l>
A piercing comfort it affords
</l>
<l>
In passing Calvary,
</l>
<l>
To note the fashions of the cross,
</l>
<l>
Of those that stand alone,
</l>
<l>
Still fascinated to presume
</l>
<l>
That some are like my own.

<l>
A LADY red upon the hill 
</l>
<l>
Her annual secret keeps;
</l>
<l>
A lady white within the field
</l>
<l>
In  placid lily sleeps!
</l>
<l>
The tidy breezes with their brooms
</l>
<l>
Sweep vale, and hill, and tree!
</l>
<l>
Prithee, my pretty housewives!
</l>
<l>
Who may expected be?
</l>
<l>
The neighbors do not yet suspect!
</l>
<l>
The woods exchange a smile —
</l>
<l>
Orchard, and buttercup, and bird —
</l>
<l>
In such a little while!
</l>
<l>
And yet how still the landscape stands,
</l>
<l>
How nonchalant the wood,
</l>
<l>
As if the resurrection
</l>
<l>
Were nothing very odd!

<l>
DEAR March, come in!
</l>
<l>
How glad I am!
</l>
<l>
I looked for you before.
</l>
<l>
Put down your hat —
</l>
<l>
You must have walked —
</l>
<l>
How out of breath you are!
</l>
<l>
Dear March, how are you?
</l>
<l>
And the rest?
</l>
<l>
Did you leave Nature well?
</l>
<l>
Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,
</l>
<l>
I have so much to tell!
</l>
<l>
I got your letter, and the birds';
</l>
<l>
The maples never knew
</l>
<l>
That you were coming, — I declare,
</l>
<l>
How red their faces grew!
</l>
<l>
But, March, forgive me —
</l>
<l>
And all those hills
</l>
<l>
You left for me to hue;
</l>
<l>
There was no purple suitable,
</l>
<l>
You took it all with you.
</l>
<l>
Who knocks? That April!
</l>
<l>
Lock the door!
</l>
<l>
I will not be pursued!
</l>
<l>
He stayed away a year, to call
</l>
<l>
When I am occupied.
</l>
<l>
But trifles look so trivial
</l>
<l>
As soon as you have come,
</l>
<l>
That blame is just as dear as praise
</l>
<l>
And praise as mere as blame.

WE like March, his shoes are purple,
</l>
<l>
He is new and high;

<l>
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,

<l>
Makes he forest dry;
</l>
<l>
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
</l>
<l>
And begets her spot.
</l>
<l>
Stands the sun so close and mighty
</l>
<l>
That our minds are hot.

Not loud enough for wind;

A star not far enough to seek,

Nor near enough to find;
</l>
<l>
A long, long yellow on the lawn,

A hubbub as of feet;

Not audible, as ours to us,

A hurrying home of little men

<l>
All this, and more, if I should tell,

<l>
Would never be believed.

Nature had left behind.

The grass does not appear afraid;

But nature is a stranger yet;

The ones that cite her most

Have never passed her haunted house,

Nor simplified her ghost.

THERE's something quieter than sleep
</l>
<l>
Within this inner room!
</l>
<l>
It wears a sprig upon its breast,
</l>
<l>
And will not tell its name.
</l>
<l>
Some touch it and some kiss it,
</l>
<l>
Some chafe its idle hand;
</l>
<l>
It has a simple gravity
</l>
<l>
I do not understand!
</l>
<l>
While simple-hearted neighbors
</l>
<l>
Chat of the 'early dead,'
</l>
<l>
We, prone to periphrasis,
</l>
<l>
Remark that birds have fled!

THE soul should always stand ajar,

That if the heaven inquire,

<l>
He will not be obliged to wait,

Or shy of troubling her.
</l>
<l>
Depart, before the host has slid
</l>

The bolt upon the door,
</l>
<l>
To seek for the accomplished guest, —
</l>
<l>
Her visitor no more.

Some disease had vexed;

'T was with text and village singing

I beheld her next,

And a company — our pleasure

To discourse alone;

<l>
Gracious now to me as any,

<l>
Gracious unto none.

Borne, without dissent of either,

<l>
I HEARD a fly buzz when I died;
</l>
<l>
The stillness round my form
</l>
<l>
Was like the stillness in the air
</l>
<l>
Between the heaves of storm.
</l>
<l>
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
</l>
<l>
And breaths were gathering sure
</l>
<l>
For that last onset, when the king
</l>
<l>
Be witnessed in his power.
</l>
<l>
I willed my keepsakes, signed away
</l>
<l>
What portion of me I 
</l>
<l>
Could make assignable, — and then
</l>
<l>
There interposed a fly,
</l>
<l>
With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
</l>
<l>
Between the light and me;
</l>
<l>
And then the windows failed, and then
</l>
<l>
I could not see to see.

ADRIFT! A little boat adrift!

<l>
And night is coming down!

Will no one guide a little boat

Unto the nearest town?
</l>
<l>
So sailors say, on yesterday,
</l>
<l>
Just as the dusk was brown,
</l>
<l>
One little boat gave up its strife,

<l>
And gurgled down and down.

But angels say, on yesterday,

Just as the dawn was red,

Exultant, onward sped!

<l>
THERE's been a death in the opposite house
</l>
<l>
As lately as to-day.
</l>
<l>
I know it by the numb look
</l>
<l>
Such houses have alway.
</l>
<l>
The neighbors rustle in and out,
</l>
<l>
The doctor drives away.
</l>
<l>
A window opens like a pod,
</l>
<l>
Abrupt, mechanically;
</l>
<l>
Somebody flings a mattress out, —
</l>
<l>
The children hurry by;
</l>
<l>
They wonder if It died on that, —
</l>
<l>
I used to when a boy.
</l>
<l>
The minister goes stiffly in
</l>
<l>
As if the house were his,
</l>
<l>
And he owned all the mourners now,
</l>
<l>
And little boys besides;
</l>
<l>
And then the milliner, and the man
</l>
<l>
Of the appalling trade,
</l>
<l>
To take the measure of the house.
</l>
<l>
There'll be that dark parade
</l>
<l>
Of tassels and of coaches soon;
</l>
<l>
It's easy as a sign, —
</l>
<l>
The intuition of the news
</l>
<l>
In just a country town.

As if the cloud that instant slit

And let the fire through.
</l>
<l>
It burned me in the night,

It blistered in my dream;

<l>
It sickened, fresh upon my sight

<l>
With every morning's beam.

I thought that storm was brief, —

The maddest, quickest by;

But Nature lost the date of this,

And left it in the sky.

ALL overgrown by cunning moss,

All interspersed with weed,

When frosts too sharp became,

Retire to other latitudes,

<l>
'T WAS just this time last year I died.

<l>
I know I heard the corn,
</l>
<l>
When I was carried by the farms, —
</l>
<l>
 It had the tassels on.
</l>
<l>
I thought how yellow it would look
</l>
<l>
When Richard went to mill;
</l>
<l>
And then I wanted to get out,
</l>
<l>
But something held my will.
</l>
<l>
I thought just how red apples wedged
</l>
<l>
The stubble's joints between;
</l>
<l>
And carts went stooping round the fields
</l>
<l>
To take the pumpkins in.
</l>
<l>
I wondered which would miss me least,
</l>
<l>
And when Thanksgiving came,
</l>
<l>
If father 'd multiply the plates
</l>
<l>
To make an even sum.
</l>
<l>
And if my stocking hung too high,
</l>
<l>
Would it blur the Christmas glee,
</l>
<l>
That not a Santa Claus could reach
</l>
<l>
The altitude of me? 
</l>
<l>
But this sort grieved myself, and so
</l>
<l>
I thought how it would be
</l>
<l>
When just this time, some perfect year,
</l>
<l>
Themselves should come to me.
